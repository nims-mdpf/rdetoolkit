- **NEW**: `SystemFilesCleaner` class automatically removes OS-specific and temporary files during ZIP extraction
- Cleans up macOS files (`.DS_Store`, `__MACOSX` directories)
- Removes Windows system files (`Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`, etc.)
- Eliminates development files (`.git`, `__pycache__`, `.idea`, etc.)
- Removes application temporary files (MS Office temp files, editor backups)
- Prevents contamination of processed data with system-generated files

### üìä Enhanced SmartTable Processing
- **IMPROVED**: SmartTable invoice initialization with better CSV-to-invoice mapping
- **NEW**: Automatic `dataName` field updates with SmartTable file names
- **IMPROVED**: Type-aware field conversion using schema information
- **NEW**: Early exit processing for SmartTable workflows with validation
- Better handling of `sample/generalAttributes` and `sample/specificAttributes`
- Enhanced error handling for CSV parsing and validation

### üîß Schema and Type System Improvements
- **NEW**: `find_field()` method in `InvoiceSchemaJson` for dynamic field lookup
- **IMPROVED**: Type conversion support for custom fields using schema definitions
